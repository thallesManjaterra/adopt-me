# Adopt Me

A small [React](https://reactjs.org/) App that loads available animals and breeds from Petfinder's API and then searches for adoptable pets of that criteria.  
Created by taking Frontend Masters' [Complete Intro to React, v5](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/complete-react-v5/) course, prepared and presented by [Brian Holt](https://frontendmasters.com/teachers/brian-holt/).

## Rough info

Uses [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) for bundling.  
Contains 2 routes, configured with [Reach Router](https://reach.tech/router).  
Uses [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) to write well formatted code.    
See [package.json](package.json) for complete list of dependencies.

## How to develop

As always, run `npm install` after cloning the repo.  
Afterwards, run `npm run dev` to start the development server. The app is then available on http://localhost:1234.
